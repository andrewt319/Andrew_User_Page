> Here is an intro about myself below: 

Hello! My name's Andrew and I'm a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student at University of California, San Diego pursuing a degree in ***Mathematics - Computer Science*** and a ***Data Science*** minor<sub>2</sub>.

I'm always seeking opportunities to learn more about computer science through internships, team projects, and organizations. At the same time, I am always looking to be involved in my community and share my knowledge and experiences as a teacher/tutor.

- `from collections import defaultdict`
